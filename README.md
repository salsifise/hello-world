so, this is my first repository.  well ðŸ˜Ž


Hi Friends, 

I am a student studying some aspects of IT and computer science from recruitment to training to benefits.
I spend these days developing my skills as a programmer where I love managing teams and solving project problems.
although I like my current role, i feel i'm now ready for a more challenging assignement and this position really excites me :) .

thanx.
